## CS70 : discrete mathematics

In my personal view, the biggest highlight of the introductory discrete mathematics course in Berkeley lies in the fact that it does not simply teach theoretical knowledge, but introduces the application of theoretical knowledge in practical algorithms in each module, so that the students of the computer department can not only strengthen the theoretical foundation, but also jump out of the cold formalized mathematical symbols to feel and experience the essence of the theory in practical application.

The corresponding relationships between specific theories and algorithms are listed as follows:

- Logical proof: stable matching algorithm

- Graph Theory: Network topology Design

- Basic number theory: RSA algorithm

- Polynomial ring: error-correcting code design

- Probability theory: hash table design, load balancing, etc

The notes of the course are also very straightforward, and the formula derivation and practical examples are sprinkled throughout. The reading experience is good.
