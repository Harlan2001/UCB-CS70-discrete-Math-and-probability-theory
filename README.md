## CS70 : discrete mathematics

This repository contains all the learning material for the UCB CS70 course : discrete maths and probability theory. 

### What you will learn ?

As a core course in computer science, CS70 not only teaches you the mathematical concepts, but also lets you use the concepts you have learned to tackle practical problems. In each chapter, there are some correlated practical algorithms which use the mathematical concepts you have just learned. 

- Notes (1 - 5) : basics of proof & stable matching algorithm
- Notes 6 : Graph theory
- Notes (7 - 8) : basic number theory & RSA algorithm
- Notes (9 - 10) : polynomial & error correcting code
- Notes (11 - 13) : Counting & Countability & Computability
- Notes (14 - 15) : basics of probability theory
- Notes (16 - 17) : random variables
- Notes (18 - 20) : concentrain inequalities  & Hash table && load balance && ......
- Notes (21) : continuous random variables
- Notes (22) : discrete Markov Chains
